fwd_prop example

contains a pair of Python scripts that propagate uncertainty in input parameters
through a heat transfer model using both a Monte Carlo sampling approach
and a non-intrusive spectral projection (NISP) via quadrature methods.

For more information, look in UQTk manual under
Forward Propagation of Uncertainty with PyUQTk
(at time of writing this page. 72, but might change)

rad_heat_transfer_atm_pce.py: main script that produces a graph comparing PDF's
        of heat flux generated using NISP full and sparse quadrature methods
        and Monte Carlo sampling method.
        The beginning of the script there are a few flags to consider.
        See manual for further explanation of flags

heat_transfer_pce_tools.py: functions called by rad_heat_transfer_atm_pce.py
