polynomial example

codes to generate a random polynomial data with noise, fit a set of polynomial
models to the data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, comparing the models to
each other using model evidence, calculate the derivatives of the models with
uncertainties, and produce other plots about the model fits.

to run full example, run run/full_run.sh
