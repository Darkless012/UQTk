tmcmc_bimodal example


contains example for sampling of 3-dimensional bimodal posterior probability density using TMCMC. The C++ libraries are called directly from the driver program.
By changing the likelihood function and the prior function in bimodal.cpp, this program can be tailored to other inference problems.
