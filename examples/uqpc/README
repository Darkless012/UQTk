examplepickleuqpc example

A collection of scripts that propagate input parameter uncertainties to output
via PC expansions.

As a special, and most commonly used, case the scripts can construct a PC
surrogate for a multi-output computational model. The latter is as a black box
simulation code. The workflow also provides tools for global sensitivity
analysis of the outputs of this black box model with respect to its input
parameters or input PC germs.

Forward Propagation of Uncertainties, Surrogate Construction
and Global Sensitivity Analysis

Files

- uq_pc.py: the main script, see ./up_pc.py -h for options

- model.py: black-box example model

- plot_prep.py: plotting before surrogate construction

- plot.py: plotting after surrogate construction, reading the pickel file
  results.pk produced by uq_pc.py.

  construction pickle files into a single file results.pk
