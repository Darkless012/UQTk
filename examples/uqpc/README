A collection of scripts that propagate input parameter uncertainties to output
via PC expansions.

As a special, and most commonly used, case the scripts can construct a PC
surrogate for a multi-output computational model. The latter is as a black box
simulation code. The workflow also provides tools for global sensitivity
analysis of the outputs of this black box model with respect to its input
parameters or input PC germs.

and Global Sensitivity Analysis

Files

- uq_pc.py: the main script, see ./up_pc.py -h for options

- model.py: black-box example model

- plot_prep.py: plotting before surrogate construction

- plot.py: plotting after surrogate construction, reading the pickle file
  results.pk produced by uq_pc.py.


  Other Scripts:
- prepare_inpc.py: Prepares PC coefficients file given marginal PCs or samples.

- generate_inputsamples.py: Auxiliary script to generate example jointly
  distributed random samples.

- join_results.py: Auxiliary script as an example of joining a set of surrogate
  construction pickle files into a single file results.pk

- model_sens.x: Auxiliary script as a sensitivity evaluation black-box for
  given PC coefficients

- transpose_file.x: Transpose a given matrix file.

- scale.x: scale a given matrix file to or from a given hypercube to [-1,1]^d.
