Window example

expanded version of the forward propagation examples in  examples/fwd_prop
uses more complex models that provide additional parameters.

================================================================================

5D_fwd_prop.py: produces a probability density function of
                the heat flux for a fifth dimension model, using fourth order PCE's.
fwd_prop_tools.py: functions called by 5D_fwd_prop.py

highd_sparse.py:  produces a probability density function of the heat flux for
                  a twelve dimension model, using fourth order PCE's
                  and sparse quadrature.
tools_conductance_dp_pce_ward.py: functions called by highd_sparse.py
